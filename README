	Weekly Exercise 7: Euler phi
# ==============================

Included Files:
	* README
	* eulerphi.cpp

Running instruction:
	1. In the directory containing eulerphi.cpp, type "g++ eulerphi.cpp -o eulerphi" to compile the program.
	2. Once the program had been compiled, type "./eulerphi" to run the program.
	3. Enter a number of your choice to view the relevant output.

Notes & Assumptions:
	* The function gcd_euclid_fast() was downloaded from eclass and used.
	* This program assumes an input range of [1, 2^32 -1].
	* The function phi() does not store all of the prime factors of n. Instead, it updates the value of phi(n) after each loop for a given nprime with its lowest prime factor.
	* In the phi() function, a small adjustment had to be made to the p found. This is because in the case where a p WAS found, an extra 1 was added to it at the end of the loop. If a p WAS NOT found, the remaining p is incorrect and is in fact equal to nprime.
